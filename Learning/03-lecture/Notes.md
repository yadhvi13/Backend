# WHAT IS API?? AND WHAT IS REST API'S??
-application programming interface , to communicate two different applications we use some set of rules and protocols called API
example- Backend server and frontend.

# TYPES OF APIS
- REST (representaional state transfer) API's
- WebSocket API's
etc....

# REST API'S
- these are stateless communication.
- if you want to communicate between server and browser, you will use HTTP protocols and use methods like (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,PATCH).

```

```
## REST API'S METHODS
1.) GET -> when we want data from server
2.) POST -> when we want to send data to server
3.) PATCH -> when data is already present on server and need to update that data on server
4.) DELETE -> to delete already present data on from server.
